 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jacob Powers

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mainly interested in Game Development, but am also interested in anything where I can apply my skills as a computer scientist such as software engineering, machine learning, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning techniques using Python as I prepare to graduate soon in Spring 2021. After I graduate I'd still like to learn C++, specifically how I can use it to develop games in Unreal Engine.
